### What I learned

 creating a "Build Result Summary" component in HTML and CSS is a practical way to develop your HTML and CSS skills, with potential extensions into JavaScript and other web technologies depending on your project's complexity. It involves a combination of front-end design and development principles to create an informative and visually appealing component for displaying build results.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
